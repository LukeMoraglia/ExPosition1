The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition
================

GSVD
====

The generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a [name shared by two different SVD techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_singular_value_decomposition). This package is for the "weighted" or "vector-constrained" GSVD. For one of the most straight forward introductions to the SVD and GSVD see the Appendices of Greenacre (1984).

Background
----------

The GSVD generalizes in two ways:

1.  it generalizes the standard SVD to allow for constraints or weights to be applied to the left and right singular vectors, and

2.  it generalizes many multivariate techniques, e.g., principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, canonical correlation analysis, partial least squares, multidimensional scaling, linear discriminant analysis, and many many more.

The GSVD is an extraordinarily powerful and flexible tool for multivariate analyses.
