# GSVD

## Background

The generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a [name shared by two different SVD techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_singular_value_decomposition). This package is for the "weighted" or "vector-constrained" GSVD. For one of the most straight forward introductions to the SVD and GSVD see the Appendices of Greenacre, M. (1984). Theory and applications of correspondence analysis. \emph{Academic Press.}
