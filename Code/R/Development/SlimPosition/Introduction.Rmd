# ExPosition

The [ExPosition](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ExPosition/index.html) family of packages are built around one technique: the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). 

SlimPosition is a new package in the ExPosition family of packages. As of now, SlimPosition is a successor to the current family of ExPosition packages but in the future, SlimPosition will be *the* core of ExPosition. 


## The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition

Let us call $\mathbf{X}$ a data matrix with $I$ rows and $J$ columns. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\mathbf{X}$ is defined as:

$$
  \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U \Sigma V}^{\text{T}}
$$
