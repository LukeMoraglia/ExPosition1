SlimPosition: *Slim*med down Ex*Position*

ExPosition
==========

The [ExPosition](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ExPosition/index.html) family of packages are built around one technique: the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD).

SlimPosition is a new package in the ExPosition family of packages. As of now, SlimPosition is a successor to the current family of ExPosition packages but in the future, SlimPosition will be *the* core of ExPosition.

The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition
--------------------------------------------

Let us call **X** a data matrix with *I* rows and *J* columns. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of **X** is defined as:

<center>
**X** = **U****Σ****V**<sup>T</sup>
