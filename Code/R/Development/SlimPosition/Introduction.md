ExPosition
==========

The [ExPosition](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ExPosition/index.html) family of packages are built around one technique: the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD).

SlimPosition is a new package in the ExPosition family of packages. As of now, SlimPosition is a successor to the current family of ExPosition packages but in the future, SlimPosition will be *the* core of ExPosition.

The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition
============================================

Let us call
**X**
 a data matrix with
*I*
 rows and
*J*
 columns. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of
$${\\bf X}$$
 is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  {\bf X} = {\bf U \Sigma V}^{T}
\end{equation}
